 * Description: A [column] shortcode plugin.
 * Version: 0.1.1
 * Author: Justin Tadlock
 * Author URI: http://justintadlock.com
 *
 * Grid Columns was created because of the sheer number of WordPress themes adding poorly-coded 
 * column shortcodes, which lock users into use that theme and system forever.  The plugin is 
 * meant to be an all-around solution for any WordPress user, regardless of theme, to be able 
 * to have columnized content using a simple [column] shortcode.
